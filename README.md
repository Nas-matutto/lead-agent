# Lead Agent v1 (DEPRECATED)

Below are the details of what I attempted to build. This was a project to test out a UX flow for Agentic Lead generation and communication. A brand new project is being worked on with this one as a base. 

An intelligent B2B lead generation tool powered by AI that helps you find and connect with your target audience.

## Features

- **Product Analysis**: Analyze your product/service to identify the ideal target audience
- **Lead Generation**: Automatically find potential leads that match your target audience
- **Personalized Outreach**: Create personalized outreach messages for each lead
- **Flexible Integration**: Connect with various LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly interface for managing the entire workflow

## Installation

- Anthropic API key (and optionally OpenAI, Deepseek)
